# Internet of Things: The Manual

## NodeMCU Distance sensor with Node server.
This IoT project allows you to set up a Node server which will:
1. display the distance between a distance sensor and an object (or person).
2. manipulate a output source like a led (or other output of your choice).

## Overview
This manual will let you use a distance sensor and let you post the data you tracked to a Node server.

## Requirements
- NodeMCU EPS8266 + WiFi board
- HC-SR04 Distance Sensor
- NodeMCU EPS8266 drivers
- Breadboard
- 1x red led
- 1x yellow led
- 1x green led
- Wires
- Arduino software

## Hardware setup

### Setting up the distance sensor

### Setting up the leds
The leds will indicate how far away you your object is from your distance sensor. On the Node Server we will set up in just a bit, we can set up when which led needs to light up.

## Software setup

### Installing Arduino Software

### Installing the drivers

## Server setup

### Clone GitHub

## Code

### Add the code to your Arduino Software

## Done!

## Demo
