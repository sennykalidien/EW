# Welcome to Everything Web!
This repository is for my school assignments for the minor Everything Web at The University of Applied Science Amsterdam in 2016.

Everything Web allowed me to learn programming with the latest front-end techniques in 2016. Each folder is a course I needed to follow in timespans of 4 weeks. 3 weeks of lessons and assignment and the last week was for our project assignment.

During these courses we did things like:
- Write in Vanilla/Native JavaScript
- Use advanced CSS3 (FlexBox & Animations)
- Apply Progressive Enhancement
- Learn to work with task managers like Gulp / Grunt
- Build Single Page Apps / Progressive Web Apps
- Use Frameworks like Node, Angular, Meteor & React.
- Work with Internet of Things (ESP's and Data collecting + displaying)
- Write documentations
- Write articles
